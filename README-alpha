This is a test release of this package.
Please do not send reports about this release to any
GNU mailing list or newsgroup.

If you see a problem that you've already reported, feel free to
re-report it -- it won't bother me to get a reminder.  Besides, the
more messages I get regarding a particular problem the sooner it'll
be fixed -- usually.  If you sent a complete patch and I didn't apply
it or get back to you, please let me know.

Please send comments and problem reports to alainm@gnu.org.
