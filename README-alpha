This is a test release of this package.  Bugs are now handled through
<bug-inetutils@gnu.org> for both released and unreleased versions of
this package.

If you see a problem that you've already reported, feel free to
re-report it -- it won't bother us to get a reminder.  Besides, the
more messages we get regarding a particular problem the sooner it'll
be fixed -- usually.  If you sent a complete patch and nobody applie
it or get back to you, please let us know!

Please send comments and problem reports to <bug-inetutils@gnu.org>.

The code is also available through anonymous CVS.  To fetch the tree
issue the following command:

  cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.gnu.org:/cvsroot/inetutils co inetutils


You will also need to get a recent version of `gnulib', preferbly from
Git.  To fetch the tree issue the following command:

  git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gnulib.git

There is a script in gnulib/build-aux called `bootstrap', that you
will need to run.  You need recent versions of automake and autoconf
for this to work.  To run it issue the following command:

  GNULIB-DIRECTORY/build-aux/bootstrap --gnulib-srcdir=GNULIB-DIRECTORY

Note that you cannot use ~ in the second GNULIB-DIRECTORY, you'll have
to replace it with $HOME or use the full path.

You can track the CVS process through the <commit-inetutils@gnu.org>
mailing list.  This is a medium volume moderated list.
