This is a test release of this package.  Bugs are now handled through
<bug-inetutils@gnu.org> for both released and unreleased versions of
this package.

If you see a problem that you've already reported, feel free to
re-report it -- it won't bother us to get a reminder.  Besides, the
more messages we get regarding a particular problem the sooner it'll
be fixed -- usually.  If you sent a complete patch and nobody applie
it or get back to you, please let us know!

Please send comments and problem reports to <bug-inetutils@gnu.org>.

The code is also available through anonymous CVS.  To fetch the tree
issue the following command:

  cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.gnu.org:/cvsroot/inetutils co inetutils.

There is a script called "autogen.sh" which will setup all of the
automatically created scripts for you.  You need automake and autoconf
for this to work.

You can track the CVS process through the <commit-inetutils@gnu.org>
mailing list.

This is a medium volume moderated list.
