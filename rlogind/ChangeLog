	Much of the changes where indentation to follow GNU
	coding style.  Use of "const" where appropriate.
	atoi() is not ANSI C nor POSIX. Preferable to use
	strto(u)l().  The same for bcopy() moving to POSIX
	mem*() functions.

	* rlogind.c:#include <sys/stat.h> is needed for chmod ().
	#include <sys/ioctl.h> is needed for the ioctl() calls.
	Remove the "static" scope since the functions were define whithout
	the static qualificator.
	(main): atoi() replace by strtoul() where needed.
	(rlogind_mainloop): Need to return a value since it is use
	as an argument to exit () add return 0.
	(getstr): argument is now const.
	(protocol): Initialize variables pdp and fpb gcc was complaining
	about it.
	(protocol): n was shadowed by another n previosuly declared
	rename the variable len and change its scope.
	(protocol): bcopy() replace by memmove().
	(control): argument change to size_t.
	(fatal): second argument now is const char *.

	--daemon options. Kerberos code is not tested, though.
