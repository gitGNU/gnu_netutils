GNU inetutils version 1.2

This is a distribution of common networking utilities and servers.

They are currently all from the 4.4BSD-Lite2 distribution, with some changes
to make them compatible with the GNU hurd (in particular, the hurd does not
define some arbitrary limits, such as MAXPATHLEN), and to remove some minor
BSD dependencies.  A GNU build environment has also been added.

As this release is intended mainly to support the GNU hurd, which is
source compatible with BSD in many ways, there are probably many BSD
dependencies remaining.

The file `paths' contains a list of all paths used by programs in this
distribution, and rules to find values for them.  To change a path PATH_FOO,
you may either tell configure, by using `--with-path-foo=VALUE' (where VALUE
may contain references to make variables such as `$(bindir)'), or edit
the `paths' file.

Some known deficiencies:
 o Most programs do not support long options, such as --version or --help.
 o The authentication and encryption options have not been tested.

GNU inetutils requires GNU make.

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.
