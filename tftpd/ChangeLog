	* It has to do with handling of files with more than 32766 blocks. The
	TFTP packets should be able to handle up to 65535 blocks. But many
	tftpd's seem to treat the block# as a short instead of an unsigned
	short. This appears to be caused by the arpa/tftp.h header declaring it
	as a short. The relevant RFC's do not indicate that this is supposed to
	be the case.
