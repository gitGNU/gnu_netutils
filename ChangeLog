2001-06-13  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@farlep.net>
	* libicmp(Makefile.am, icmp.h, icmp_cksum.c, icmp_echo.c,
	  icmp_timestamp.c,libping.c,ping.h): added to repository.
	  Currently it is more libping than libicmp, I will be adding
          required functionality latter.
	* ping/ping.c: implemented
	* ping_address.c, ping_echo.c, ping_impl.h, ping_router.c,
	  ping_timestamp.c: added to repository.
	* paths: PATH_HEQUIV needs search in <netdb.h> (for Solaris)

2001-06-05  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@farlep.net>

	* libinetutils/ttymsg.c (normalize_path): Define static and provide
	a prototype and it was call with the wrong number of arguments.

2001-06-05  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@farlep.net>

        * ftpd/ftpd.c: MAP_FAILED is not defined on some systems
          (e.g. Solaris, SunOS)
        * headers/paths.h: Added missing _PATH_LOGCONF, _PATH_LOGPID,
          _PATH_LOG
        * libls/print.c: Provided defaults for major() and minor() macros
          for systems lacking them.

2001-06-02  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@farlep.net>

	* libinetutils/ttymsg.c: Simple check for '/' in the line name is
	way too week: it doesn't work for tty names like pts/2, which are
	perfectly OK. Changed to more sophisticated one: all "./", "../"
	references in the name are resolved and the resulting name is
	compared with PATH_TTY_PFX. If it lies under it, everything's
	Ok. Otherwise we just bail out and quit.
	* talk/display.c: Added check for *text == '\a' to produce audible
	bell.
	* talk/io.c: changed \007's in initial message to beep() after
	message(). On solaris's AT386 those \007 just produce ^G on
	the screen.
	Changed read(0, buf, nb) to getch() in loop. Reason: read()
	returns raw data from console, thus pressing <enter> returns
	'\r' which gets displayed on console as ^M, because display.c
	is expecting to get '\n'. getch() returns '\n' and everything
	goes smooth.
	* talk/announce.c: syslog error message from ttymsg(). One never
	knows...
	* talkd/process.c: changed find_user(). Previous version returned
	first console the remote party was logged onto. This one returns
	the one where he currently is. This is a slightly modified version
	of berkeley's find_user() dated 1997/04/06.

	Remove from CVS repository - They are automatically generated.

1999-05-19 Alain Magloire
	* configure.in : check for ptsname(), this will give
	a hint to use SYSVR4 pseudo ptys handling.  particularly
	for telnetd and rlogind.
	* libinetutls/utmp_{init,logout} : new files.
	* libinetutils/openpty.c : a new version that should be
	compatible with SYSV STREAM.

1999-05-18 Dan Stromberg

	larger files (twice as big), without sacrificing anything.
	We need this to allow sgis to roboinst from a sun tftp server.
