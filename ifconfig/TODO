XXX Before check in:

Rework changeif.c
Implement flags support in changeif.c and options.c
Fix and move if_index.c to libinetutils.
Fix system.c, system.h stuff.

XXX Some systems can provide more interfaces than SIOCGIFCONF/if_nameindex,
    interfaces which are usually not UP but registered nevertheless.
    (linux: /prov/net/dev). Some support for that?

XXX Honour IFF_CANTCHANGE when working in flag setting in brdaddr,
    dstaddr, etc.

XXX We could put the option parsing (invocation of getopt_long) into a function
    like parse_opt_rest, which could be used by system_parse_opt_rest to continue
    parsing the options as usual after processing a not-option.

XXX Is it necessary to merge long/short options intelligently?
    For example, if a system specific option shadows a normal option?
    Allow this?

XXX To make ${join} work properly, it needs to know if there was some
    output at all.
