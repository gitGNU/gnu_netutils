This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Mon Oct 12 20:49:18 MET DST 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
Avoid logging of SIGCHLD when syslogd is in the process of
exiting and closing its files.  Again thanks to Topi.
	
	* syslogd.c (init): New variable was_initialized.
	Set Initialize to 0 temporarily to avoid logging of SIGCHLD.

2000-08-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (main): Really fix getopt argument this time.
	Break after acting on option '-n'.
	(crunch_list): Remove semicolon that makes a prototype from
	the implementation (doh!).

2000-08-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (usage): Beautify with package name and version number.

2000-08-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (cvthname): Fix some really stupid errors in last change.

2000-08-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (domark): Don't log mark if MarkInterval is <= 0.
	* syslogd.8 (SYNOPSIS): Add '-l', '-r', '-n' and '-s' (oops).
	Document behaviour of '-m 0'.

2000-08-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c: Fix prototype of debug_switch.
	(cfline): In case '|', check for terminal and console.
	In case '/', rearrange this very check.
	(debug_switch): Fix parameter list to match prototype.
	Don't install signal handler here.

	* syslogd.c (repeatinterval): Shorten from 30, 120, 600
	to 30, 60. This is what Linux sysklogd 1.3 uses.

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Mon Feb 10 00:09:11 MET DST 1997:  Martin Schulze
Improved debug code to decode the numeric facility/priority
pair into textual information.

	* syslogd.c (textpri): New prototype and function.
	(logmsg): Use textpri in log message.

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (cfline): Instead number 0 use char '\0'.
	Make debug output nicer by better alignment.

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (init): Replace hard coded "/dev/console"
	by PATH_CONSOLE.

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (cfline): Fix off-by-one error. We have to
	take into account "LOG_MARK" which has facility number
	LOG_NFACILITIES.

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (main): Add "-s" option to getopt invocation.

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

This is based on the equivalent Linux change:
Thu Oct 19 00:02:07 MET 1995:  Martin Schulze
The default behavior has changed for security reasons. The
syslogd will not receive any remote message unless you turn
reception on with the "-r" option.

	* syslogd.c (AllowRemote): New global variable.
	(main): New option "-r" to set AllowRemote.
	Only if AllowRemote is true add inetm to readfds
	and check for messages from there.
	(usage): Document new option "-r".
	(init): In start-up message, show if we allow remote messages.
	* syslogd.8: Document new option "-r".

	(init): In start-up message, show package name and version
	number (like: "GNU inetutils 1.3.2c").

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

This is the equivalent to the following Linux changes:
Wed Nov 22 22:32:55 1995:  Martin Schulze
Added the fabulous strip-domain feature that allows us to
strip off (several) domain names from the fqdn and only log
the simple hostname. This is useful if you're in a LAN that
has a central log server and also different domains.

I have also also added the -l switch do define hosts as
local. These will get logged with their simple hostname, too.

	* syslogd.c (LIST_DELIMITER): New symbol.
	(StripDomains, LocalHosts): New variables.
	(crunch_list): New prototype and function.
	(main): New options "-s" and "-l".
	(usage): Document "-s" and "-l".
	(cvthname): Use StripDomains and LocalHosts to frob
	the hostname before returning.
	* syslogd.8: Document new options "-s" and "-l".

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	Merged from the Linux source (sysklogd 1.3):
	* syslogd.c (debugging_on): New global variable to toggle debug output.
	(debug_switch, dprintf): New prototypes, new functions. Redefine dprintf
	to mydprintf when __GLIBC__ is defined.
	Remove macro for dprintf.
	(main): Set debugging_on to true early, and to false again before
	entering main loop. Install debug_switch as SIGUSR1 handler.

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	Merged from the Linux source (sysklogd 1.3):
	* syslogd.c (F_FORW_SUSP): New symbol.
	(F_FORW_UNKN, F_PIPE): Increment value, to make space for F_FORW_SUSP.
	(TypeNames): Insert name for F_FORW_SUSP.
	(fprintlog): Add case for F_FORW_SUSP.
	In case F_FORW use F_FORW_SUSP on error (and not F_FORW_UNKN).
	Add debug message.
	(init): Handle case F_FORW_SUSP in debug output like F_FORW.

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (NoDetach): New global variable.
	(main): New option "-n". If NoDetach is true, don't
	background and detach from controlling terminal.
	(usage): Document new option n.
	* syslogd.8: Document new option "-n".

2000-07-05 Alain Magloire

1999-10-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <brinkmd@debian.org>

	* syslogd.c (main): Type of len changed from int to size_t.
	(usage): Add -V option, make output consistent with other GNU tools.

	* syslogd.8: Document "-V" option.

	* syslogd.c (logmsg): Only accept priority if the exact bit
	is set (instead of an inequality).
	(cfline): negate_pri, excl_pri, pri_set, pri_clear: New variables.
	Allow '!' and '=' prepended to priority specification to exclude
	these resp. higher priorities.

	* syslogd.c (printline): Add SYNC_FILE to logmsg
	invocation for more reliability.
	(struct filed): New member f_flags to hold new macro OMIT_SYNC.
	(logmsg): Only fsync if OMIT_SYNC is not set.
	(cfline): Clear f_flags at initialization.
	Set OMIT_SYNC in f_flags if action is prepended by `-' in
	the conf file.

	* syslog.conf.5: Document level modifiers '!' and '='.
	Add `-' rule.

1999-10-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <brinkmd@debian.org>

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:

Wed Feb 14 12:42:09 CST 1996:  Dr. Wettstein
Allowed forwarding of messages received from remote hosts to
be controlled by a command-line switch.  Specifying -h allows
forwarding.  The default behavior is to disable forwarding of
messages which were received from a remote host.

	* syslogd.c: New global variable "NoHops".
	(main): New option "-h" to clear NoHops.
	(usage): Document new "-h" option.
	(fprintlog): New argument (char *) from.
	If from != LocalHostName and NoHops set, don't forward
	message.
	(logmsg): Add from argument to fprintlog invocation.
	(domark): Likewise.
	(die): Likewise.
	(init): Likewise.

	* syslogd.8: Document new "-h" option.

1999-10-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <brinkmd@debian.org>

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Wed Jul 26 18:57:23 MET DST 1995:  Martin Schulze
The 'LocalDomain' and the hostname of a remote machine is
converted to lower case, because the original caused some
inconsistency, because the (at least my) nameserver did respond an
fqdn containing of upper- _and_ lowercase letters while
'LocalDomain' consisted only of lowercase letters and that didn't
match.

	* syslogd.c (main): Try harder to get the FQDN of
	localhost and convert LocalDomain to lowercase. (This should
	probably be in libinetutils).
	(cvthname): Add "." to output strings.
	Convert hostname to lowercase before comparing with LocalDomain.

1999-10-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <brinkmd@debian.org>

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Tue May 28 00:58:45 MET DST 1996:  Martin Schulze
Corrected behaviour of blocking pipes - i.e. the whole system
hung.  Michael Nonweiler <mrn20@hermes.cam.ac.uk> has sent us
a patch to correct this.  A new logfile type F_PIPE has been
introduced.

	* syslogd.c: New macro F_PIPE.
	(TypeNames): New logfile type PIPE.
	(fprintlog): Support for F_PIPE added.
	(init): Likewise.
	(cfline): Likewise, use '|' in conf file.
	(cfline): Open log files with O_CREAT and
	permission 0644.

	* syslog.conf.5: Add documentation for new logfile type PIPE.

1999-10-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <brinkmd@debian.org>

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Mon May 20 13:29:32 MET DST 1996:  Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>
Added continuation line support.

	* syslogd.c (init): Add support for continuated lines
          (implemented by Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>).

	* syslog.conf.5: Mention continuated line feature.

1999-10-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <brinkmd@debian.org>

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Mon Aug 21 22:10:35 MET DST 1995:  Martin Schulze
Corrected a strange behavior during parsing of configuration
file. The original BSD syslogd doesn't understand spaces as
separators between specifier and action. This syslogd now
understands them. The old behavior caused some confusion over
the Linux community.

	* syslogd.c (cfline): Allow space as delimiter.

	* syslog.conf.5: Seperator can now be a space, too.

1999-10-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <brinkmd@debian.org>

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Thu Oct 26 13:14:06 MET 1995:  Martin Schulze
Added another logfile type F_FORW_UNKN.  The problem I ran into
was a name server that runs on my machine and a forwarder of
kern.crit to another host.  The hosts address can only be
fetched using the nameserver.  But named is started after
syslogd, so syslogd complained.
This logfile type will retry to get the address of the
hostname ten times and then complain.  This should be enough to
get the named up and running during boot sequence.
Sat Jan 10 01:33:06 CET 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
Fixed small bugs in F_FORW_UNKN meachanism.  Thanks to Torsten
Neumann <torsten@londo.rhein-main.de> for pointing me to it.

	* syslogd.c: INET_SUSPEND_TIME, INET_RETRY_MAX,
	F_FORW_UNKN: New macros.
	TypeNames: Add "FORW(UNKNOWN)". If gethostbyname fails for some host,
	this type will retry INET_RETRY_TIMES times before it finally fails.
	(fprintlog): New variable hp. Move clearing f_time inside every
	case it is appropriate for. Add new case F_FORW_UNKN. New goto
	target f_forw. Only clear f_prevcount if appropriate.
	(init): Do not close f_file for F_FORW. Add debug output for
	F_FORW_UNKN.
	(cfline): If gethostbyname fails, set f_type to F_FORW_UNKN instead
	giving up instantly.

1999-06-08  Marcus Brinkmann  <brinkmd@debian.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (MAXSVLINE): Increase number.
	(cfline): Double size of ebuf.

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (decode): Double buffer size.

199-08-07  Marcus Brinkmann  <brinkmd@debian.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (usage): Add -V option,
	make output consistent with other GNU tools.

1999-08-07  Marcus Brinkmann  <brinkmd@debian.org>

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Mon Oct 12 22:18:34 CEST 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
Modified printline() to support 8bit characters - such as
russion letters.  Thanks to Vladas Lapinskas <lapinskas@mail.iae.lt>.

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (printline): Make eight bit clean for our
	friends in Russia (and other).

1999-06-08  Marcus Brinkmann  <brinkmd@debian.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (fprintlog): Use snprintf instead of sprintf.
	* syslogd/syslogd.c: Fixed typo in comment.
	* syslogd/syslogd.c: Include <version.h>.
	(main): Add option -V (version).
