	* localhost.c: Prototype xrealloc, not xalloc.
	(localhost): Add missing parenthese.

2000-10-30  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* utmp_init.c: Define __USE_GNU before including utmpx to get
	prototype of updwtmpx.

2000-08-24  Alain Magloire

	* stub_tgetent.c: Prototype was wrong.
	* openpty.c: Prototype was wrong.

2000-08-15  Alain Magloire

	* iruserok.c: use <signal> not <sys/signal.h>
	Remove ruserok().

	* ruserok.c: new funtion.

2000-08-13  Alain Magloire

	* ttymsg.c (fork2):  New function, that is doing a double
	fork() when I/O is non-bloclking.

2000-08-11  Alain Magloire

	* poll.c: Update from James Antill.

2000-08-08  Alain Magloire

	* ttymsg.c: Formatting, bcopy() to memcpy().
	Just check for '/' in the path for security attempts.

	* poll.c: Typo in prototypes. Not including <sys/select.h>
	* poll.h: Typos.

2000-08-05  Alain Magloire

	* daemon.c (waitdaemon):  We are using the double trick
	to avoid zombies and control terminals.  So we're going
	simply to pause() to avoid messing with waitpid().

2000-08-05  Alain Magloire

	* localhost.c: No longer use static buffers to cache the result.
	This cause subtil bugs and make it impossible in non-threaded
	environment if we ever move to it.

2000-08-04  Alain Magloire

	* iruserok.c (iruserok):  Typo in prototype.

2000-08-03  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	(waitdaemon_timeout): If child told us to go away, use _exit rather
	than exit.

2000-08-03  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* daemon.c (waitdaemon): New function from FreeBSD syslogd rev 1.66.
	(waitdaemon_timeout): Likewise (but called timedout in FreeBSD syslogd).
	(daemon): Redefine in terms of the more generic waitdaemon.

2000-07-14 Alain Magloire

	* openpty.c: ptys_open() call wrong arguments ...

	* Makefile.am: AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = ansi2knr
	all the files are now prototype and we rely on ansi2knr
	to the right thing.

2000-07-05 Alain Magloire

	* *: Clause 3 removed.
