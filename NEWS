Release 1.2 is an attempt to be somewhat more portable, and reorganize the
code to make porting a bit easier; it is still very BSD-specific.  A major
bug in ftpd bug that prevents most logins from succeeding is fixed, as well
as other, more minor, bugs.

Release 1.1 is a minor release intended only for the GNU hurd.  This release
adds checking for crypt at both compile and runtime (on systems where weak
refs are supported).
