# This is the configuration file for the GNU whois client; it lists the
# pattern for a whois query on the left, and the whois server on the right.
# Comments start with # characters and go to the end of the line.
#
# If a server name is specified by an @ in the name to look up or with the
# -h option, that will be used.  If those options don't provide any server
# specification, then configuration files will be searched in this order, and
# the first match will be used: the file specified by --config-file,
# $HOME/.whois-servers, $SYSCONFDIR/whois-servers,
# $DATADIR/inet/whois-servers, and finally the version of the config file
# that is supplied with the inetutils that is compiled into the whois binary.
#
# Unless something bizarre happens on your system, the compiled in config
# file is identical to $DATADIR/inet/whois-servers.
#
# It is recommended that if you want to locally override the list of whois
# servers, you put your list in $SYSCONFDIR, so that you can install a new
# version of the inetutils without having your configuration clobbered.
