@cindex introduction

The individual utilities was originally derived from the 4.4BSDLite2
distribution.  Many features were integrated from NetBSD, OpenBSD,
FreeBSD and GNU/Linux, the merges were done by a group of decicated
hackers(in no particular order): Jeff Bailey, Marcus Brinkmann, Michael Vogt,
Bernhard Rosenkraenzer, Kaveh R. Ghazi, NIIBE Yutaka, Nathan Neulinger,
Jeff Smith, Dan Stromberg, David O'Shea, Frederic Goudal, Gerald Combs,
Joachim Gabler, Marco D'Itri.

Certain options are available in all these programs.  Rather than
writing identical descriptions for each of the programs, they are
described here.  (In fact, every GNU program accepts (or should accept)
these options.)

Many of these programs take arbitrary strings as arguments.  In those
cases, @samp{--help} and @samp{--version} are taken as these options
only if there is one and exactly one command line argument.

     The effects of multiple selectors are sometimes not intuitive.  For exam-
     ple ``mail.crit,*.err'' will select ``mail'' facility messages at the
     level of ``err'' or higher, not at the level of ``crit'' or higher.
