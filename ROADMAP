This is the 1.4.0 release, to celebrate the fact that it should
compile and that we have a new ping, gwhois, and talk.  I would like
to release this by the 21st of February.

The 1.4.1 will be a maintenance release with various patches
discovered from 1.4.0 and the build system reworked.  I probably won't 
start work on this until I'm back at the end of March.  Assume a  
summer release or so.

1.5.0 will be a release that tries to put as much as possible into
libraries (startup code, etc).  I also would like to try and write (or
convince someone else to write) a gopher and gopherd pair.
